	<p>Multi Experience development platforms (MXDPs) are used by businesses to quickly grow their apps through a range of devices and platforms.
	 MXDPs are a way for companies to constantly change with the times and be seen as a 'trendy' company. This is hugely important to a company 
	 and benefits them massively in the long run. This is the difference between a company lasting ten years and a company being a household name 
	 for fifty years. MXDPs can assist a company in developing a single app that can be used across a multitude of devices and platforms. This shortens
	development times as well as reducing efforts and costs. It also gives the brand more control over their digital experiences.</p>
