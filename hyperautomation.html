	including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation 
	extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, 
	design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” <a href="https://www.solvexia.com/blog/what-is-hyperautomation-a-complete-guide">Source</a> In short description,

	 advanced artificial intelligence. Together with human interaction, hyper automation creates a workplace that is capable of using data to 
	 make quick and informed decisions, as well as being agile and briefed.</p>
